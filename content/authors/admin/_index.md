My research focuses on multiphysics modeling for functional and energy materials, such as lithium-ion batteris and green steel. I and my team aim at developing new theories and models to investigate complex physical phenomena such as mechanical failure, crack propagation, elastoplastic deformation, and nonlinear constitutive laws. As a modeler proficient in cutting-edge technologies, I am also dedicated to developing software that will accelerate my simulations while optimizing material performance for sustainable design.
